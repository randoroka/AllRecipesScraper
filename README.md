## AllRecipesScraper

This is a program which scrapes recipe information from a specified recipe link from Allrecipes.com and outputs it to a text file. Records ingredients, recipe details, and directions. This program could be more convenient for those with slower internet connections, as manually visiting the website might be too slow due to loading extra, unnecessary content.
